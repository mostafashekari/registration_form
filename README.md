# registration_form

In this form, which is written in JavaScript, validation is done when we click on the registration option. And the conditions defined for the fields are as follows:
Full name field: The full name can only consist of English alphabets and spaces, otherwise an error should be displayed.
Email field: email validation should be in such a way that first there are a few characters without spaces, then we have the @ character, and then we have a few characters without spaces after that dot, and at the end there are again a few characters without spaces be Otherwise, an error should be displayed
Password field: The password must contain at least 8 characters, including at least one number, one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter, otherwise an error will be displayed. I hope this is useful
